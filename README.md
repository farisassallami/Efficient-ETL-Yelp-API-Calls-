# Efficient Yelp API Calls
 
### Assignment Description

This project involved working with the Yelp API to search for Indian restaurants in New York City. The goal was to extract all the results from the search and compile them into one dataframe using a for loop, as demonstrated in the lesson "Code for Efficient API Extraction."

### City and Cuisine Type

For this assignment, I chose New York City as the city and Indian cuisine as my preferred cuisine type.

### Yelp API

I created a Yelp account and obtained my Yelp API credentials to use for this project. The Yelp API is a powerful tool that allowed me to search for businesses, restaurants, and other venues based on their location, type, and other parameters.

### Procedure

I used the Yelp API to search for Indian restaurants in New York City, and then I extracted all the results from the search using a for loop. I compiled the results into one dataframe, which made it easier to analyze the data and gain insights into the Indian restaurant scene in New York City.

### Conclusion

Working on this project gave me a great opportunity to practice using the Yelp API and to demonstrate my skills in working with APIs and dataframes. I learned a lot about data extraction and manipulation, and I gained valuable experience working with APIs in Python. This project was both challenging and rewarding, and I am glad to have completed it.
